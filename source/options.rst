Changing MongoDB Options
========================

You may require a configuration change for your application. MongoDB allows
configuring the database with a configuration file, as many other database
management systems do. You can pass options to MongoDB instances in the cluster
in one of the following ways:

* edit the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file,
* use a ConfigMap,
* use a Secret object.

You can pass configuration settings separately for **mongod** Pods,
**mongos** Pods, and **Config Server** Pods.

Edit the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file
---------------------------------

You can add MongoDB configuration options to the 
:ref:`replsets.configuration<replsets-configuration>`,
:ref:`sharding.mongos.configuration<sharding-mongos-configuration>`, and
:ref:`sharding-configsvrreplset-configuration<sharding-configsvrreplset-configuration>`
keys of the ``deploy/cr.yaml``. Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   spec:
     ...
     replsets:
       - name: rs0
         size: 3
         configuration: |
           operationProfiling:
             mode: slowOp
           systemLog:
             verbosity: 1
         ...

See the `official manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/>`_
for the complete list of options, as well as
`specific <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/rate-limit.html>`_
`Percona <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/inmemory.html>`_
`Server <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/data_at_rest_encryption.html>`_
`for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/log-redaction.html>`_
`documentation pages <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/audit-logging.html>`_.

Use a ConfigMap
---------------

You can use a `ConfigMap <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/>`__
and the cluster restart to reset configuration options. A ConfigMap allows
Kubernetes to pass or update configuration data inside a containerized
application.

You should give the ConfigMap a specific name, which is composed of your cluster
name and a specific suffix:

* ``my-cluster-name-rs0-mongod`` for the Replica Set (mongod) Pods,
* ``my-cluster-name-cfg-mongod`` for the Config Server Pods,
* ``my-cluster-name-mongos`` for the mongos Pods,

.. note:: To find the cluster name, you can use the following command:

   .. code:: bash

      $ kubectl get psmdb

For example, let's define a ``mongod.conf`` configuration file and put there
several MongoDB options we used in the previous example:

.. code:: yaml

     operationProfiling:
       mode: slowOp
     systemLog:
       verbosity: 1

You can create a ConfigMap from the ``mongod.conf`` file with the
``kubectl create configmap`` command. It has the following syntax:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl create configmap <configmap-name> <resource-type=resource-name>

The following example defines ``my-cluster-name-rs0-mongod`` as the ConfigMap
name and the ``mongod.conf`` file as the data source:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl create configmap my-cluster-name-rs0-mongod --from-file=mongod.conf=mongod.conf

To view the created ConfigMap, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl describe configmaps my-cluster-name-rs0-mongod

.. note:: Do not forget to restart Percona Server for MongoDB to ensure the
   cluster has updated the configuration (see details on how to connect in the
   :ref:`Install Percona Server for MongoDB on Kubernetes<operator.kubernetes>`
   page).

Use a Secret Object
-------------------

The Operator can also store configuration options in `Kubernetes Secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_.
This can be useful if you need additional protection for some sensitive data.

You should create a Secret object with a specific name, composed of your cluster
name and a specific suffix:

* ``my-cluster-name-rs0-mongod`` for the Replica Set Pods,
* ``my-cluster-name-cfg-mongod`` for the Config Server Pods,
* ``my-cluster-name-mongos`` for the mongos Pods,
  
.. note:: To find the cluster name, you can use the following command:

   .. code:: bash

      $ kubectl get psmdb

Configuration options should be put inside a specific key:

* ``data.mongod`` key for Replica Set (mongod) and Config Server Pods, 
* ``data.mongos`` key for mongos Pods.

Actual options should be encoded with `Base64 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>`_.

For example, let's define a ``mongod.conf`` configuration file and put there
several MongoDB options we used in the previous example:

.. code:: yaml

     operationProfiling:
       mode: slowOp
     systemLog:
       verbosity: 1

You can get a Base64 encoded string from your options via the command line as
follows:

.. code:: bash

   $ cat mongod.conf | base64

.. note:: Similarly, you can read the list of options from a Base64 encoded
   string:

   .. code:: bash

      $ echo "ICAgICAgb3BlcmF0aW9uUHJvZmlsaW5nOgogICAgICAgIG1vZGU6IHNsb3dPc\
      AogICAgICBzeXN0ZW1Mb2c6CiAgICAgICAgdmVyYm9zaXR5OiAxCg==" | base64 --decode

Finally, use a yaml file to create the Secret object. For example, you can
create a ``deploy/my-mongod-secret.yaml`` file with the following contents:

.. code:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: my-cluster-name-rs0-mongod
   data:
     mongod.conf: "ICAgICAgb3BlcmF0aW9uUHJvZmlsaW5nOgogICAgICAgIG1vZGU6IHNsb3dPc\
      AogICAgICBzeXN0ZW1Mb2c6CiAgICAgICAgdmVyYm9zaXR5OiAxCg=="

When ready, apply it with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl create -f deploy/my-mongod-secret.yaml

.. note:: Do not forget to restart Percona Server for MongoDB to ensure the
   cluster has updated the configuration (see details on how to connect in the
   :ref:`Install Percona Server for MongoDB on Kubernetes<operator.kubernetes>`
   page).
