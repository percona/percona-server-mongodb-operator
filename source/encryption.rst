Data at rest encryption
************************

`Data at rest encryption in Percona Server for MongoDB <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/data_at_rest_encryption.html>`_ is supported by the Operator since version 1.1.0.

.. note:: "Data at rest" means inactive data stored as files, database records, etc.

Following options the ``mongod`` section of the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file should
be edited to turn this feature on:

#. The ``security.enableEncryption`` key should be set to ``true`` (the default
   value).
#. The ``security.encryptionCipherMode`` key should specify proper cipher mode
   for decryption. The value can be one of the following two variants:
   
   * ``AES256-CBC`` (the default one for the Operator and Percona Server for
     MongoDB) 
   * ``AES256-GCM``
   
#. ``security.encryptionKeySecret`` should specify a secret object with the
   encryption key:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      mongod:
        ...
        security:
          ...
          encryptionKeySecret: my-cluster-name-mongodb-encryption-key

   Encryption key secret will be created automatically if it
   doesn't exist. If you would like to create it yourself, take into account
   that `the key must be a 32 character string encoded in base64 <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/#local-key-management>`_.
